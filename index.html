                    <p class="paragraphs">Being Exceptional in Yourself is a value that I hold close, although, what does that actually mean?
                                          <br><br>
                                          For me, that means focusing on becoming a better version of yourself than you were the day before.
                                          A version of you that learns from acknowledging previous mistakes and shortcomings, taking their lessons into account, and being determined to discover a solution to them.
                                          This is a philosophy that I consistently aim to apply to my daily interactions, in all facets of my life. I always try to be a better me, improving my relations with myself
                                          and the individual that I am to those around me. Strangers, colleagues, and important individuals to myself alike.
                                         <br><br>
                                         Applying this mindset to the work environment is what I plan to do, to aim to excel in what I do through trial and failure. Learning from where I went wrong in the past, and using
                                         these occurences as lessons to improve the way I do my work in future</p>

                    <p class="paragraphs">Being Exceptional in Your Work is a value that I am still in the process of learning, and am determined to nurture as I further my career. However, the value of such is one that I believe applying and practicing consistently throughout my efforts.
                                          <br><br>
                                          Whether it's through studies, personal projects, or the working environment, I believe that dilligence, determination, and passion is required to excel in what you do.

                    <p class="paragraphs">Being Exceptional in Your Attitude can be seen as the practice of constantly trying to maintain a positive attutude, regardless of the scenario. However, I believe otherwise.
                        <br><br>
                        I believe that we are all human at the end of the day, individuals with thoughts and emotions, aspirations and perceptions of our own. It would be unrealistic to deny the existence of both negative and positive aspects surrounding these things, and that is why I believe that
                        the correct attitude is one of not giving up. Having bad days and being able to keep going, maintaining your passion regardless of what is being thrown at you.

                    <p class="paragraphs">Being Exceptional in Your Ethics is a value that holds a lot of meaning to me, as integrity and staying true to what you believe in resonates with me deeply.
                                          <br><br>
                                          Staying true to my ethics is an integral part of who I am, and choosing to do what is right, rather than what is easy has always been a philosophy I strive to enact in my life. 
                                          Through maintaining honesty and openness, being exceptional in ones ethics is what I aim to implement in all faculties of my life. Whether it be with personal relations, relations with colleagues,
                                          or the relationship with myself.

                    <p class="paragraphs">Being Exceptional in Everything, the overarching value that incited the creation of this web page, and the value that sits at the core of all values mentioned.
                                          <br><br>
                                          The meaning behind the value encompasses all that we do, every day of our lives. It refers to being exceptional in the way we carry ourselves around our friends and family,
                                          the way we interact with our colleagues and clients, and the way we conduct ourselves alone. We should always try to apply ourselves with the mindset of going above and beyond in everything we do.
                                          Whether this be something as simple as greeting those around you, or something as important as an essential project for a client, the effort put into both should always be at maximum capacity.

                                          Throughout my journey with NetConfig, I have the goal of applying this, and all aforementioned values as I aim to prove that I really am a Purple Cow
